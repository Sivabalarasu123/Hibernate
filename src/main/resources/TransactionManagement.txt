(@Transactional)
fail between transaction - inconsistent -> we need to roll back the changes

ACID:
=====
A - Atomicity   -> either successful trnsaction or all the chnages to be revert back.
C - Consistency -> leaving the system in consistent state irrespective of whether transaction suceed or failed
I - Isolation   -> How hnages visible within transcation to other transaction.
D - Durabilty   -> Once transcation is successful even if other system failures happened.

// 2 transcations running in parallel
dirty read -> another trans reading other modifying transaction before completing it.
Non Repeatable read -> when readig the same value twice during transction, return the 2 diff values (data)
Phanthom read -> when readig the same value on diff time a during transction, return the diff values (rows)

ISOLATION LEVELS (4)
====================
Read uncommitted
Read committed -> Mostly used
Repeatable Read
Serializable -> good but poor performance
